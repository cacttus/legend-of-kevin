## About The Game's Development
Wrote this in 2 days from a branch of another game of mine.  The game is written in monogame.  (Would have liked to do a lot more with this but been very busy turkey weekend :'().  

I am also submitting this game for my game design class  final in two weeks, so, it will definitely get a ton of updates after the game-off including:

more collidables, 
better jump physics, 
additional platforms, 
bigger world, 
speed optimizations.  
fun with water
lava
enemies?
If you find this game interesting, check back in 2 weeks!
