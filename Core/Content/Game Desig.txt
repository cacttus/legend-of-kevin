2. need multiple layers for foreground & Background.

if the game is custom.  if generated.
but how can we make it generated?  

game flow - 
pickaxes gate the player by barring entrances to new areas.
monster battles - level up the guy.
pickaxe power = axe type * guy power

1 big level that we custom detail - but that rings for having a level editor.
we can't generate this.

player finds bottles to get powerups

Generate - because this isn't the culminating game.
So my new idea:
Generate levels as areas.
