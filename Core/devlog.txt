6/23
fixed doors
fixed saving and save issues
UpdateSprite, Serialize, Deserialize, CreateNew

6/22
Saving.. - 
The issue bug/ is that the player tile is in the world, but it's
trying to deserialize it from that location.  
we want to treat the player separately from all the static tiles (chest/door/switch)
player moves around, don't worry about player position

6/21
Fixed Bound box rotations 
Fixed an issue where particles weren't getting destroyed

6/17
sparkles onc hests
added 3 kinds of grub monster
added dirt background (as opposed to having just cave background)
started save point stuff, saving

6/15 or 16
started save point stuff

6/13 
removed hanging

6/11
Fixed grub crawl path + fixed rotation issue by taking the dot prodcut of the perpendicular of the plane normal
added right rotated grubs movement

shield
plant bomb guy (to test sheild)


6/9
fix the background not showing black

For the guy - 
keep the guy object between each room

save/load - serialize the guy
	keys, bombs
serialize all treasure chests
serialize all locked/unlocked doors
serialize all dead bosses.




5/31
Fixes to portal transitions & Portals
**We should remove the bidirectional portals and just hard code each in/out
**ADded ability for lava manipulation or / water ripples with screen shader (Drawing to rendertarget)
**Modified Bomb Physics, but still doesn't work.
**Added glowfish
**Added water levl.
*BEGAN to add Float Blocks.  Float blocks will be useful when we create Ice

6/6
Removed IsPortal

6/3
AddinG*** decal tiles for

** GLOW FLOWER ** 

Fixing cave-1 to add glow flowers for better visibility

Spring Boots
Bombs
Merman Armor

Boomerang
Ice Pick
Serpant Armor

Rocket Booster
Power Bomb

WE NEED BOX SCAN
I belivee the physics is correct as is - the way to fix the Jump-Through
is to do the box-scan thing and cut the velocity vector.

6/6
BORDER PORTALS / WALL PORTALS
Started on Wall portals.
Removed the entrance/exit crap in favor of simple trigger portals.
Start the guy AT the trigger for wall portsls
Start the guy in front/ to the right for border portals

Shark Enemy

Bug Enemy

Power Sword - You can powerup your sword if you hold the click. This breaks through crystal walls.

Crystal Rock


6/5

**TODO FIX THE BOUND BOXES USING REL BOX FOR ALL OBJECTS**
All statics don't collide anymore because of the RELATIV bound box

Fixed/Added ball physics
Added particles.
Added Bombs
Added Potions
Added Hearts/Life
+UI stuff to go along with those.

**TODO FIX GUY PHYSICS FOR SLOPES
Possibly we'll use the ball physics routine for guy physics

**FIX JITTERY ITEMS

lava particles + glow, portals, bombs + bomb stuff, green grass blocks, green gem blocks,  lots of sprites

Next Steps: Skeles, 


5/22
